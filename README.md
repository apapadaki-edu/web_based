# Sensors

The program scans for available sensors in the user agent and displays as rows:

1. a button that activates and deactivates the sensor (a disabled button in case the sensor isn't found)
2. an input field in which the user defines the period with which the measurements are displayed
3. a cell that displays the measurements (shows the results once the sensor is activated)

For a sensor to start the user must press the button, provide a period and press enter. 
For the sensor to deactivate the user must press the button again.
Note: The user can change the period while the sensor is active, by changing its value in the input field and pressing enter once again.
