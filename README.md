Web Applications (each on its own branch)

  - First is a sample page of an eshop and a new user form. It focuses mainly on styling for now. [Art Store](../../tree/art-store-front-end) (html, css, php)
  - Second one is just a notebook that uses local storage for saving the notes. [Notepad](../../tree/note-pad) <br> (html, css, javascript)
  - Third one is an app that scans for sensors and when provided a period, the measurements are displayed on screen [Sensor Playground](../../tree/sensors) (html, css, javascript)

Currently, most projects are getting updated, with both improving code (from the semester initially developed) and adding more features.

I would be extremely grateful for any feedback or tips on how to improve or change these projects. It would help immensely my development as a programmer.
